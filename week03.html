        <h2>Objects</h2>
    <p>An object is a self-contained set of properties and values. For example, a laptop is an object that contains 
      HDDs,SSDs and CPUs with values. A value with a property as a function is known as a method. Objects are usually used 
      to contain related information with the same or similar functionality in one box. Objects represent real world objects in a virtual
      world.
    </p>

      <section id="objEx">
          <h3>Example of object literal</h3>
          <p>
            <strong>
      const nanaKwame = {<br>
          firstName: "Nana Kwame ",<br>
          lastName: "Dickson",<br>
          age:25<br>
          school:byui,<br>
          nationality: Ghana   <br>       
      };
    </strong>
          </p>
    </section>
  
    <section>
        <p>
            An object literal can easily be created by using curly braces {}.<br> It is also possible to create an object with the constructor
            function; nana = new Object()
        </p>

    </section>
    <h3>Accessing Properties</h3>
    <p>Properties can be accessed in two ways. One way is by the dot notation(nana.name) and the other is by using square brackets (nana ['name'])</p>

    <h3>Computed Properties</h3>

    <p>JavaScript code can be put in square brackets[] and the property key will return the value of that code. <br>
        <section id="objEx">
            <h3>Example of Computed Properties</h3>
              <strong>
                const hulk = { name: 'Hulk', ['catch' + 'Phrase']: 'Hulk Smash!' };<br>
                << { name: 'Hulk', catchPhrase: 'Hulk Smash!' }   
        };
      </strong>
            </p>
      </section>

      <h3>Finding all the Properties of an Object</h3>
      <p>
          We can loop through properties using the <em>for in</em> loop. We can use the example below to loop through all the 
          properties of the object <strong>superman.</strong>

          for(const key in superman) {
            console.log(key + ": " + superman[key]);
        }
        << "name: Superman"
        << "real name: Clark Kent"
        << "height: 75"
        << "weight: 235"
        << "hero: true"
        << "villain: false"
        << "allies: Batman,Supergirl,Superboy"
        << "fly: function (){
            console.log(\"Up, up and away!\");
        }"

      </p>

      <h3>Adding and Removing Properties</h3>
      <p>Properties can be added to objects at anytime. One can simply do this by assigning a value to a property. For instance;
          adding a value of spouse to the object nana would be,<strong id="objEx"> nana.spouse = Jane. This would return << "Jane"</strong>

          Properties can be removed with the delete button. One can use the <em> delete</em> operator. Example, <em>delete</em> nana.spouse.
              </p>

              <h3>Nested Properties</h3>

              <p>JavaScript objects can contain other objects as well. These are called nested objects.

                <section id="objEx">
                    <h3>Example of Nested Objects</h3>
                      <strong>
                        const jla = {<br>
                            superman: { realName: 'Clark Kent' },<br>
                            batman: { realName: 'Bruce Wayne' },<br>
                            wonderWoman: { realName: 'Diana Prince" },<br>
                            flash: { realName: 'Barry Allen' },<br>
                            aquaman: { realName: 'Arthur Curry' },<br>
                        }
                };
              </strong>
            </section>

            <h3>Name Spacing</h3>
            <p> Name spacing is done in JS programming to prevent name collisions from occuring. Because developers use libraries
                some common names may be repeated. When this happens, there will be a problem when executing a code.
                This is remedied by using a name space. To create a name space, a variable has to be created to house the object.
                To be able to use the object with a common name, you need to invoke the variable name along with the object name
                with the dot notation

                <section id="objEx">
                    <h4>Example</h4>
                    <strong>
                    const myMaths = {<br>

                        square(x) {<br>
                            return x * x;<br>
                        },<br>
                        mean(array,callback) {<br>
                            if (callback) {<br>
                            array.map( callback );<br>
                            } <br>
                            const total = array.reduce((a, b) => a + b);<br>
                            return total/array.length;<br>
                        }<br>
                    };
                </strong>
                </section>
            </p>


            <h3>JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)</h3>
            <p>JSON is used by many services for data serialization and configuration. It is used for exchange of information
                betwen web services. It is used by big websites like Facebook, Twitter and Trello. <br>
                JSON is both machine and human readable. The key differences to note is that, Property names must be double-spaced,
                permitted values are double-quoted strings, numbers, true, false, null, arrays and objects and Functions are not permitted values.
                The parse() method takes a string of data in JSON format and returns a JavaScript object.<br>
                <br>
                <strong>Document Object Module (DOM)</strong><br>
        The Document Object Model (DOM) permits you to get to components of a site page and empower connection with the page by adding and eliminating components, changing the request, content and traits of components, 
    and even its style is adjusted.

    DOMS are able to access an HTML page by using the document.getElement. Examples include. <em>document.getElementById, 
        document.getElementByTagname, document.getElementByClassName
    </em>
<h3>Query Selector</h3>
The document.querySelector() method allows for the use of CSS notation to find the first element
 in the document that matches that matches a CSS selector that has been provided as an argument.
  .If it cannot match any elememts, it returns null.

The document.querySelectorAll() method also uses CSS notation but returns a node list of all the elements in the
 document that match the CSS query selector. If no elements match, it will return an empty node list.

 <h3>Navigating the DOM Tree</h3>
Node objects have a number of properties and methods for navigating around the document tree. Once an element has been referenced, 
other nodes can be found on the document tree.
 Example. The relationship each node has with the Batman node is shown below.

 <section id="objEx">
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <strong>
        const heroes = document.getElementById('roster');<br>

        heroes.childNodes<br>
        NodeList [#text "<br>
        ", <li class="hero">, #text "<br>
        ", <li id="bats">, #text "<br>
        ", <li class="hero">, #text "<br>
        ", <li class="hero">, #text "<br>
</strong>
</section>
<em>childNodes</em> property returns all the nodes that are children of an element. This includes text nodes,
 and since whitespace is treated as a text node, there will be empty text nodes in the collection in the example above.
</p>

<h3>EVENT LISTENER</h3>
<p>An event listener is code that listens all the time for a mouse click, keypress or a touch input. An event listener 
    calls a function when a part of a webpage is clicked on and has something to do. Until that happens, the code will continue to run.
    The recommended way of dealing with events is to use event listeners.
    The addEventListener() method is called on a node object, the node to which the event listener is being applied.
    The addEventListener() method can also be called without a node,
    in which case it is applied to the global object, which is often the whole browser window.

    <section id="objEx">
        <h4>Event Listener Example</h4>
        <strong>

    function doSomething() {<br>
        alert('You Clicked!');<br>
        }<br>
        
        addEventListener('click',doSomething);
    </strong>
</section>

Event listeners can be removed using the removeEventListener() method. Default behavior can also be stopped with the 
preventDefault() method.
</p>

<h2>Object Methods "this"</h2>
<p>Usually, object methods need access to information in an object to perform tasks. "this" method is used to access an object.
    Usually, using a variable and a dot notation of the object method makes it possible to access information in an object,
    however, this method is not reliable. There will be a collision if another object bears the same name. This is where the "this"
    method comes in handy.

    <section id="objEx">
        <h4>Example</h4>
        <strong>
            let user = { <br>
                name: "John", <br>
                age: 30,<br>
              
                sayHi() {<br>
                  alert( user.name ); // leads to an error<br>
                }<br>
              
              };
              
              
              let admin = user;<br>
              user = null; // overwrite to make things obvious<br>
              
              admin.sayHi(); // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null<br>
              
        </strong>
    </section>
In JavaScript, <em>this</em> can be used in any function, even if it is not a method of an object. "this" is evaluated during run-time.

<section id="objEx">
    <h4>Example</h4>
    <strong>
let user = { name: "John" };<br>
let admin = { name: "Admin" };<br>

function sayHi() {<br>
  alert( this.name );<br>
}

// use the same function in two objects<br>
user.f = sayHi;<br>
admin.f = sayHi;<br>

// these calls have different this<br>
// "this" inside the function is the object "before the dot"<br>
user.f(); // John  (this == user)<br>
admin.f(); // Admin  (this == admin)<br>

admin['f'](); // Admin (dot or square brackets access the method – doesn't matter)
</strong>
</section>
This method comes in handy and prevents collisions. The arrow function has not "this" method.
