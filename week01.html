    <h1>Notes for week 01</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Computers are stupid because they cannot remember anything, except they have been programmed to do so. </li>
        <li>This is because, once an application stops, it forgets everything that it was doing.</li>
        <li>Information stored or shared is an output and ones entered are inputs. Commonly called IO by tech experts.</li>
    </ol>
    </p>
    
    <h2>Code Example</h2>
    <h1>Story Editor</h1>
    
    Story Name:<input id="name_input"></input>
    <section>
        <button onclick="loadStory()">Find and Edit</button>
        <button onclick="saveStory()">Save it</button>
        <button onclick="displayStory()">Display it</button>
    </section>
    <textarea id="story_editor" placeholder="Write your story here."></textarea>
    <section id="story_display"></section>

    <h2>
        Understanding the example
    </h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Javascript has functions that makes it easier to input, store and retrieve information </li>
        <li>Variables are used to store key-value pairs.</li>
        <li>Key value pairs have a relationship. The keys are usually the names/labels and the values are what they contain or what they are worth.</li>
        <li>Items not properly labeled can cause confusions</li>
    </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Why Mobile First Design</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Designing for the smallest devices leads to focus on functionality and design</li>
            <li>Desktop computers took 30 years to peak. This means, developers spent 30 years designing PC first</li>
            <li>The introduction of the iPhone changed the web development focus, from desktop first to mobile first</li>
            <li>In 5 years, mobile sales surpassed desktop computers by a huge margin</li>
            <li>People spend time surfing the web on phones than on laptops</li>
            <li>Phones are typically replaced in 2 years, whereas desktops and laptops are replaced around its 4th year pr beyond</li>
            <li>These days one person can be found to own two or more phones, whilst one or two computers are utilized by an entire household</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3> Responsive Retrofitting</h3>
    <p>
        This is process is used to make a desktop-only site into a responsive one.
        <ul>

        </ul>
        <ol>
            <li>It is cheaper and faster than rewriting code from scratch</li>
            <li>It gives better mobile experience than PC only</li>
            
        </ol>

        <ul>
            <li>Cons</li>
        </ul>

        <ol>
            <li>Ot does not address screen real estate issues</li>
            <li>It does not affect touch interaction issues</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h3>Why Mobile First?</h3>
    <p> Mobile first design ensures that the built website or application is robust and responive. It does have only one draw back. 
        It takes time, and rebuild can be costly. Its positives outweigh its negative. They are:

        <ol>
            <li>It provides the best experience across many devices</li>
            <li>It addresses the constraints of size and bandwith</li>
            <li>It is future friendly and ready for growth</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <h2>Trend</h2>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Desktop sales have been declining since 2011</li>
            <li>People use phones more than they use laptops or desktops</li>
            <li>When designing, one can start small and scale up</li>
        </ol>
    </p>


    <h3>Issues Encountered This Week</h3>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Setting Up Github has proved to be very frustating</li>
            
            <li>Sitepoint codes are taking forever</li>
            <li>Difficult getting help</li>
            <li>Okay, so I finally made it!</li>
