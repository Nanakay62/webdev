        <h1>Programming Basics</h1>
        <p>Programming is about making a computer do what you want. Making a program means giving a computer a set of 
            instructions to perform a task.
        </p>

        <h2>Comments</h2>
        <p>A piece of code ignored by the language. Comments are made to make anyone who is reading the code understand what is going on.
            In Javascript, there are two types of comments. They are;
            <ul>
                <li><bold>//</bold> for single line comments</li>
                <li><bold>/* & */</bold> for multi-line comments</li>
            </ul>
            Writing comments in code is good practice.
        </p>

        <h2>JS Grammer</h2>
        <p>Javascript is made up of statements that end with a semicolon(;) or with a new line.
            It is not mandatory to use a semi-colon to statements written in JS, since the language has an Automatic Semi-colon Insertion
            Process (ASI). This process attempts to place semi-colons at the end of each statement. This however, may lead to errors and 
            cause automated services like minifiers and validators not to work properly.
        </p>

        <h2>Block</h2>
        <p>A block is a series of statements collected inside curly brackets.<br> Example; <br>
             {<br>
                 const = "Hello world";<br>
                 alert(message);<br>            
        }</p>

        <h2>Reserved Words</h2>
        <p>Reserved words are ones that cannot be used as variable names. These include; char, default, byte, boolean, delete etc.</p>

        <h2>Primitive Data Types</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><bold></bold>String</li>
            <li><bold></bold> Boolean</li>
            <li><bold></bold> Numbers</li>
            <li><bold></bold>Undefined</li>
            <li><bold></bold> Null</li>
            <li><bold></bold> Numbers</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Variables</h2>
        <p>They are used to refer to a value that is stored in memory
            Javascript uses "const" and "let" to declare variables. The "=" sign is used to assign a variable
            When a const is used, a variable cannot be reassigned, however, when "let" is used, the variable may be reassigned.
            Both are block scoped and hence, exist inside the blocks in which they are declared.
            <br>
            A variable that starts with an underscore _ refers to private properties and methods. $ is used in JQuery.
        </p>.
        <h3>Soft Equality and Hard Equality</h3>
        <p>Soft Equality has double Equal signs <strong>==</strong> whilst Hard Equality has triple equal signs <strong>===.</strong></p>
        
        <h2>ARRAYS</h2>
        <p>An array is an ordered list of values that are created by using a pair of square brackets. A constructor function, new Array()
            can be used, how ever, a pair of square brackets [] are preferred because it involves less typing. <br>
            The <bold>length</bold> property is used ti determine the length of an Array. The <bold>join()</bold> method can turn the array into
            a string that compresses all items separated by commas.
        </p>

        <h2>Sets</h2>
        <p>A set is a data structure that contains a unique set of values that cannot contain duplicates. The number of values in
            a set can be determined using the size method.
        </p>

        <h1>Functions</h1>

        <p>A function is code that can be referenced by name and is almost like a small self-contained mini-program.</p>

        <h2>Defining Functions</h2>
        <p> Functions can be defined in three main ways. They are; functional declarations, expressions and arrow methods.</p>

        <h2>Invoking A function</h2>
        <p>Invoking a function means to run a code inside the function's body. invoking is done by typing the name of the 
            function, and followed by a parentheses. When using functions, there is no need to write repetitive blocks of code and all 
            functionality is kept at one place. An example is; hey(). Calling the function name followed by the parentheses is invoking.
        </p>

        <h2>IReturn Values</h2>
        <p> Return statements are used to return the value of functions. A function that does not return anything returns "undefined"
            as default.
        </p>
        <h2>Parameters and Arguments</h2>
        <p>They represent values provided for a function as an input. The difference between them are that, a parameter is the 
            variable listed inside the parentheses in the function definition and an argument is the value that is sent to the
            function when it is called.
        </p>


        <h2>Arrow Functions</h2>
        <p>Arrow funtions were introduced in ES6. They require less typing. This function is denoted by an arrow symbol =>
            The parameters come the arrow and then the main body follows thereafter. It is written in this manner;<br>const sqaure =x =>x8x.

            <h4>Advantages of arrow Functions</h4>
            Arrow function various benefits:

They are considerably less verbose than ordinary declarations.
Single boundaries don't require placing into enclosures.
The body of the function doesn't require setting inside a square on the off chance that it's just a single line.
The return keyword isn't needed on the off chance that the return  is the main assertion in the body of the function.
They don't tie their own value of "this" to the function.
        </p>

        <h2>Callbacks</h2>

        <p>A function can be given as a parameter in another function. This is called a callback. A callback is provided as a parameter and 
            is invoked inside the funtion. This type of function should not be used often because when it is used for long function definitions,
            it can be difficult to tell where the callback starts and ends.

            Code example;<br>

            function sing(song)<br> {<br>
                console.log(`I'm singing along to ${song}`);
            }<br>
            
            sing('Let It Go')<br>
            << 'I'm singing along to Let It Go'
        </p>
